//! A lightweight Datalog engine in Rust
//!
//! The intended design is that one has static `Relation` types that are sets
//! of tuples, and `Variable` types that represent monotonically increasing
//! sets of tuples.
//!
//! The types are mostly wrappers around `Vec<Tuple>` indicating sorted-ness,
//! and the intent is that this code can be dropped in the middle of an otherwise
//! normal Rust program, run to completion, and then the results extracted as
//! vectors again.
